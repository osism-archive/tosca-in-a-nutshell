Java
----

Java is a technical component allowing other software components to choose the required Java version.

Some Ystia components need a Java component to run.

A Java node is hosted on a Compute node.
The components that need Java, are hosted on the Java node using a prerequisite named **host**,
with the capability **org.ystia.java.pub.capabilities.JavaHosting**.

****

**Note**
  In the topology templates provided with Ystia, the relationships between Compute, Java and
  Ystia Component hosted on Java, are already configured.
