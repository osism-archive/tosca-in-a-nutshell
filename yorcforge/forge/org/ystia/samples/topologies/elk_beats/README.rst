Import Components and Topology template
---------------------------------------

  This step may be skipped in case you use Alien4Cloud's git integration for CSARs management

Upload the following Ystia components' CSARs to the Alien4Cloud catalog, and respect the order in the list:

#. **common**
#. **consul**
#. **java**
#. **kafka**
#. **elasticsearch**
#. **logstash**
#. **kibana**
#. **beats**
#. **dummylogs**

Upload the **elk_beats** topology archive to the Alien4Cloud Topology template catalog.

Topology template
-----------------
The **elk_beats** template provides the following configuration:

- Relationships between the ELK components are created.

- ELK components are designed to be deployed on Compute hosts and appropriate Java distribution.

- Consul allows Elasticsearch cluster discovery. I contains information about the application's services.

- A compute hosting the DummyLogsGenerator component and a FileBeat component, both pre-configured to share the logs file.
  A relationship is created to connect FileBeat with Logstash.

- A MetricBeat component is installed on each node hosting ELK components and on the node hosting the Consul server.
  It is connected to Elasticsearch.

- A PacketBeat component is installed on the Kibana and Elasticsearch nodes, and the relationship is created to connect them with Elasticsearch.

- The kibana node is hosting the DummyLogsDashboard but also a specific Dashboard allowing to show monitoring data shipped by the Beats components.


Create an application
---------------------
The application can be created via the Alien4Cloud GUI using the **elk_beats** topology shown below:

   :scale: 100
   :align: center

Complete configuration
----------------------

- You will need to upload a **Logstash** configuration file using **filter_conf** artifact.
  Use the *logstash-dummylogs-filters.conf* file, located the config repository of the Dummylogs Ystia component.

- Deploy application and when the application is running, connect to the Kibana GUI using the component's **url** output attribute

- You may open the DummyLogs_V5 dashboard, the MetricBean and PacketBean dashboard.
  Because of a known issue with the MetricDashboard (https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/9571),
  it is necessary to reload some indexes: in the *Management* view, click to *Index Patterns*, select packetbeat-* index
  and refresh the field list using the dedicated icon.
