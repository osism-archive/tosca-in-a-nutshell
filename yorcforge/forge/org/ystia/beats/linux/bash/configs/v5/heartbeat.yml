################### Heartbeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is an example configuration file highlighting only some common options.
# The heartbeat.full.yml file in the same directory contains all the supported options
# with detailed comments. You can use it for reference.

# You can find the full configuration reference here:

# Configure monitors
heartbeat.monitors:
#- type: http

  # List or urls to query
#  urls: ["http://localhost:0000"]

  # Configure task schedule
#  schedule: '@every 10s'

  # Total test connection and data exchange timeout
#  timeout: 16s

- type: icmp # monitor type `icmp` (requires root) uses ICMP Echo Request to ping
             # configured hosts

  # Monitor name used for job name and document type.
  #name: icmp

  # Enable/Disable monitor
  enabled: true

  # Configure task schedule using cron-like syntax
  schedule: '*/10 * * * * * *' # exactly every 10 seconds like 10:00:00, 10:00:10, ...

  # List of hosts to ping
  #ICMP_HOSTS_PLACEHOLDER#
  hosts: ["localhost"]

  # Configure IP protocol types to ping on if hostnames are configured.
  # Ping all resolvable IPs if `mode` is `all`, or only one IP if `mode` is `any`.
  ipv4: true
  ipv6: true
  mode: any

  # Configure file json file to be watched for changes to the monitor:
  #watch.poll_file:
    # Path to check for updates.
    #path:

    # Interval between file file changed checks.
    #interval: 5s

  # Total running time per ping test.
  timeout: 16s

  # Waiting duration until another ICMP Echo Request is emitted.
  wait: 1s

- type: tcp # monitor type `tcp`. Connect via TCP and optionally verify endpoint
            # by sending/receiving a custom payload

  # Monitor name used for job name and document type
  #name: tcp

  # Enable/Disable monitor
  #enabled: true

  # Configure task schedule
  schedule: '@every 10s' # every 10 seconds from start of beat

  # configure hosts to ping.
  # Entries can be:
  #   - plain host name or IP like `localhost`:
  #       Requires ports configs to be checked. If ssl is configured,
  #       a SSL/TLS based connection will be established. Otherwise plain tcp connection
  #       will be established
  #   - hostname + port like `localhost:12345`:
  #       Connect to port on given host. If ssl is configured,
  #       a SSL/TLS based connection will be established. Otherwise plain tcp connection
  #       will be established
  #   - full url syntax. `scheme://<host>:[port]`. The `<scheme>` can be one of
  #     `tcp`, `plain`, `ssl` and `tls`. If `tcp`, `plain` is configured, a plain
  #     tcp connection will be established, even if ssl is configured.
  #     Using `tls`/`ssl`, an SSL connection is established. If no ssl is configured,
  #     system defaults will be used (not supported on windows).
  #     If `port` is missing in url, the ports setting is required.
  #TCP_HOSTS_PLACEHOLDER#
  hosts: ["localhost:0000"]

  # Configure IP protocol types to ping on if hostnames are configured.
  # Ping all resolvable IPs if `mode` is `all`, or only one IP if `mode` is `any`.
  ipv4: true
  ipv6: true
  mode: any

  # Configure file json file to be watched for changes to the monitor:
  #watch.poll_file:
    # Path to check for updates.
    #path:

    # Interval between file file changed checks.
    #interval: 5s

  # List of ports to ping if host does not contain a port number
  # ports: [80, 9200, 5044]

  # Total test connection and data exchange timeout
  #timeout: 16s

  # Optional payload string to send to remote and expected answer. If none is
  # configured, the endpoint is expected to be up if connection attempt was
  # successful. If only `send_string` is configured, any response will be
  # accepted as ok. If only `receive_string` is configured, no payload will be
  # send, but client expects to receive expected payload on connect.
  #check:
    #send: ''
    #receive: ''

  # SOCKS5 proxy url
  # proxy_url: ''

  # Resolve hostnames locally instead on SOCKS5 server:
  #proxy_use_local_resolver: false

  # TLS/SSL connection settings:
  #ssl:
    # Certificate Authorities
    #certificate_authorities: ['']

    # Required TLS protocols
    #supported_protocols: ["TLSv1.0", "TLSv1.1", "TLSv1.2"]


#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# Multiple outputs may be used.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
#output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  #hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  #ELASTIC_SEARCH_OUTPUT_PLACEHOLDER#

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  #protocol: "https"
  #username: "elastic"
  #password: "changeme"

#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
#output.logstash:
  # The Logstash hosts
  #hosts: ["localhost:5044"]
  #LOGSTASH_OUTPUT_PLACEHOLDER#

  # Optional SSL. By default is off.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

  # Client Certificate Key
  #ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]
