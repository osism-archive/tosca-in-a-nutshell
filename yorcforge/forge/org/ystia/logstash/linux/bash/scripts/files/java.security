# The Java-level namelookup cache policy for successful lookups:
#
# any negative value: caching forever
# any positive value: the number of seconds to cache an address for
# zero: do not cache
#
# default value is forever (FOREVER). For security reasons, this
# caching is made forever when a security manager is set. When a security
# manager is not set, the default behavior in this implementation
# is to cache for 30 seconds.
#
# NOTE: setting this to anything other than the default value can have
#       serious security implications. Do not set it unless
#       you are sure you are not exposed to DNS spoofing attack.

# The Java-level namelookup cache policy for failed lookups:

#
# In some Microsoft Windows networking environments that employ
# the WINS name service in addition to DNS, name service lookups
# that fail may take a noticeably long time to return (approx. 5 seconds).
# For this reason the default caching policy is to maintain these
# results for 10 seconds.
