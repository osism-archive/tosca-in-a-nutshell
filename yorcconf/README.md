# Info

In this folder you'll find templates for locations used by `yorc bootstrap`
Note: Do not use these and fill in the missing content.
Rather use `yorc bootstrap --review` and follow the wizzard. Once you've reached the
review point, you can use `:save tmp.yaml` (if you are using vim) to save the file
and edit it. There are some things you might want to change / add. Cross check then
with these templates.
